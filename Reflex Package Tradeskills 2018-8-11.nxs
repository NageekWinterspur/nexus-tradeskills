For more information about the serverside queue, look at HELP\n\tQUEUE while in game\n\nBuild Notes:\n\t\n\t(8/5/2018)\n\tWhat some of the stuff does.\n\n\tFor inkmilling:\n\t\n\t\t\tAliases:\n\t\n\t\t(CASE SENSITIVE) mill(color) <numofbatches> <inkperbatch>: allows you to mill multiple batches and also customize how \n\t\tmany inks you can  make. EX. millgreen 20 5 will mill 20 batches of 5 inks per batch. No need to take stuff fromm rift\n\t\tas it does this for you.\n    \t\n       \n       \t\tmillstop: stops the inkmilling so that you do not have to stop all your scripts.\n        \n        \tblueswitch: switches the default blue reagent between lumic and inkbladder\n        \n        \tredswitch: switches the default red reagent between redclay and red chitin\n        \n        \tstartup: runs the onLoad function so you do not have to restart to set up\n        \n\n   \t\tTriggers:\n       \n       \t\tA trigger to take ink from mill and puts it into the rift automatically\n            \n\n\tFor Gathering:\n\t\n\t\tAliases:\n    \t\n\t\tg <thing>: Allows you to just gather the thing you want without having to type in gather <thing>. Also has support for\n\t\tbutchering by letting you type g <reagentname> (Ex. \"g scales\" will \"butcher fish for scales\" while \"g inkbladder\" will\n\t\tbutcher\n\t\tsquid.\n       \n       \t\trefine <times> <thing>: Allows you to refine repeatedly how ever many times you need to. Need 100 sugar but do not want\n\t\tto press\n       \t\tenter 100 times? This alias is for you. Also puts the refined ingredient in the rift so you do not lose it.\n        \n        \trefinestop: Someone walk in and you need to move? Your city is being raided and you need to move? Whatever the reason,\n\t\tif you\n\t\tneed to stop refining before the number of times you planned on, just do stoprefine and you will stop.\n\n\n   \t\tTriggers:\n     \t\n\t\tA trigger that, no matter what you gather, it rifts what ever it is.\n\t\n        \tA trigger to rift stuff after you butcher\n\t\n        \tA trigger to empty your hands and wield the cleaver if you try to butcher without it\n        \n\t\tA trigger that notifies you when you get a gold flake and makes you make a happygasp (Just a fun thing, can disable this\n\t\tor change the emote, has no effect on anything.)\n        \n\t(8/8/2018)\n   \t\n    For Gathering:\n    \tAliases:\n        \n        dg <thing1> <thing2>: This alias allows you to gather/butcher two items at once. This is useful for when you want to gather both lumic moss\n        \tand diamond dust while in an underground room but do not want to retype it for both.\n\nEventually, the plan is to have this package have support for all the tradeskills but as I only have Gathering and Inkmilling, that will\ntake a little time. I am hoping that I can find people to help me improve and build it so that it includes all the tradeskills\n\n","items":[]},{"type":"function","name":"onLoad","enabled":true,"id":408,"code":"//Used to
